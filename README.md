## Disclaimer

The mental health assessment questionnaire is just one tool in the process of determining a diagnosis, and a comprehensive assessment should also include a clinical interview and possibly additional evaluations such as cognitive testing or a physical examination. This platform is not intended to replace professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. If you are experiencing a mental health crisis or have thoughts of self-harm, please seek immediate help by contacting a crisis hotline or seeking help from a mental health professional.
